<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
Colorado College's Tutt Library is a small, urban, academic library serving the needs of over 2,000
students along with faculty and staff in Colorado Springs, Colorado. As a member of the Colorado
Alliance of Research Libraries, a consortium of academic and public libraries in Colorado and
Wyoming, we participate in a union catalog comprising the collections of our member institutions. We
operate our own instance of III's Millennium ILS, and our Islandora/Fedora Institutional Repository
is hosted through the Colorado Alliance's repository service. Like most academic libraries, our
material budgets have shifted from physical to electronic resources and, as a consequence, we are
doing more batch loading of MARC records for these electronic resources and less original or
copy-cataloging of print material.
</p>
<p>
With the quality of vendor-supplied MARC records varying considerably, the old workflows to
manipulate and load records into our legacy ILS were often long and laborious processes. By
scripting the manipulation of these MARC records with Python and the pymarc Python module 
[<a id="ref1" href="#note1">1</a>], then developing a web frontend in Django, we brought 
considerable time savings to our cataloging staff.  This lead to a second project Django 
application that enabled senior students to self-submit their thesis or final essay, along with 
any supporting datasets, to our Fedora Commons digital repository.
</p>
<p>
A parallel effort was started as we looked at various commercial and open source options for a new
discovery layer. Given monetary and resource constraints, along with the worry of maintaining
multiple codebases in different programming languages and environments, the library decided to fork
Kochief, a Django-based discovery project. This decision led to the release of Aristotle, the
Tutt Library discovery-layer project available on Github under the Apache 2 open source license.
</p>
<p>
In 2011, we started to explore using Redis, a popular NoSQL technology, to represent bibliographic
and operational information. This research lead to the FRBR-Redis datastore project that was the
topic of a 2012 Code4Lib presentation [<a id="ref2" href="#note2">2</a>]. The FRBR-Redis datastore
has over 850 unit tests that demonstrate Redis's ability to represent MARC and MODS metadata as well
as RDA FRBR entities as Redis data primitives.
</p>
<h2>More about Redis</h2>
<p>
Redis, a key-value datastore, is one of the many new NoSQL data technologies that offer alternative
models for data representation and use. Redis supports data persistence in two ways: an RDB mode
that saves the dataset at periodic intervals, and an AOF mode that saves the dataset with every
write operation. While there are advantages and disadvantages to each approach [<a id="ref3"
href="#note3">3</a>], most libraries could employ a combination of RDB mode for bibliographic
records and AOF mode for library transactional data like circulation statistics.
</p>
<p>
Redis is fundamentally different from the flat-file structure of a MARC record and the relational
databases of more traditional library systems. The flexibility of Redis allows for the rapid
development of multiple apps by supporting different information schemes and structures within a
single datastore.  For example, in the Aristotle Library Apps project, RDA Core FRBR entities and
attributes are extracted from MARC records following the MARC-to-RDA mappings provided in the ALA's
RDA Toolkit  [<a href="ref4" href="#note4">4</a>]. Meanwhile, financial information, such as
material orders and invoice information stored in our ILS, is extracted and added to the Redis
datastore for reporting and budget forecasts. We even store the library hours as Redis Primitives in
the datastore for use in a standalone app and as a JSON data feed for our discovery layer.
</p>
<p>
The manner in which a Redis key is constructed allows for the embedding of semantic or heuristic
information about the data structure in its naming structure.  Redis assumes that related data use a
key naming pattern, and even provides a global function to increment the key ID. For the Aristotle
Library App project, for example, each of the first group of FRBR entities (Work, Expression,
Manifestation, and Items) are represented with the following pattern for each entity:
<code>rda:{name-of-entity}:{increment value}</code>. In addition, the three FRBR entities (Person,
CorporateBody, and Subject), as well as with the RDA Title element, are represented with the same
key structure.
</p>
<p>
Another important design consideration when using Redis is the type of data primitive to associate
with a key. The simplest value is an atomic string. For example, in the Aristotle Library App, all
RDA Core Carrier Types are simple keys that return a value.  Using the Redis "GET" command on the
key <code>rda:CarrierType:2</code> would return a string value of "DVD". The real power of Redis,
however, is revealed in the use of other data primitives. 
</p>
<p>
The Redis list is a collection primitive which stores unordered and duplicate string values. The
Redis set and sorted set store unique string values, with the sorted set associating a sort weight
with each value in the sorted set. If a weight of 0 is used in a sorted set, Redis does a lexical
sort based on the string values in the set. The last Redis data primitive is a hash. A Redis hash
associates multiple sub-keys with a single Redis key and with the <code>HGET</code> command returns
the value associated with that sub-key.
</p>
<p>
Redis is not a relational database and it would be suboptimal to attempt to replicate an RDBMS.  In
Redis, the key is the fundamental structure, not a table-row as in an RDBMS. Redis keys can also
serve as a string value for other keys in the datastore, providing a sort of crude SQL JOIN, but
offering more flexibility in representing relationships between keys in a manner that would be
difficult or impossible to replicate in an RDBMS. The downside is that referential integrity
between different tables is not built into Redis. Eventual consistency can be achieved either
through application logic or through strategies involving a combination of Redis server commands.
</p>
<p>
The Redis string, set, sorted set, list and hash data primitives all offer different ways to
represent library information in the Redis server. Redis also provides a number of server and
primitive-specific commands that ease application development, including <code>EXIST</code> and
<code>TYPE</code>. For the <code>EXIST</code> command, a string is passed in as a parameter and a
boolean is returned confirming whether the string is a key in the datastore. The <code>TYPE</code>
command, when passed in a key string, returns the type of Redis data structure that is represented
by the key or a null value if it doesn't exist.
</p>
<p>
For large datasets that may not fit into RAM; the lead developer on the Redis project, 
Salvatore Sanfilippo, recommends using a presharding  [<a id="ref5" href="#note5">5</a>]
</p>
<h2>Redis as a Native FRBR Datastore</h2>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
To facilitate the development of library apps, the Redis datastore interactions are abstracted via
Python classes, which are built with the redis-py module [<a id="ref6" href="#note6">6</a>]. If the
app developer needs custom data storage or extended Redis functionality, Python custom classes can
extend existing classes through direct manipulation of the datastore.
</p>
<h2>HTML5, Responsive Web Design, and Twitter Bootstrap</h2>
<p>
While native apps generally run faster and more closely follow the recommended user interface
guidelines for their respective platforms, the Tutt Library does not have the resources to maintain
multiple app development environments. Thankfully, a countertrend has been the development of CSS
and JavaScript libraries that allow for fast and easy-to-use HTML5 apps that are more universal and
can run on multiple mobile and tablet platforms as well as on personal computers running more modern
web browsers. The goal of responsive web design, as expressed in the original article on A List
Apart:
</p>
<blockquote>Rather than tailoring disconnected designs to each of an ever-increasing number of web
devices, we can treat them as facets of the same experience. We can design for an optimal viewing
experience, but embed standards-based technologies into our designs to make them not only more
flexible, but more adaptive to the media that renders them. In short, we need to practice
responsive web design. [<a id="ref7" href="#note7">7</a>]</blockquote>
<p>
The Aristotle Library App project uses the popular web framework Bootstrap as the basis for the user
interfaces that respond and adjust for different client devices and displays.  It is prohibitively
expensive and impossible for a small library with limited staff and resources to test out apps on
all of the different platforms, web browsers, and devices used by our users. By focusing on the most
popular and available devices in the library (Windows 7, Macintosh, iOS, and some Android phones and
tablets), the Tutt Library targets specific functionality needed by its patrons and staff. The
design intention of this HTML5-based app development environment is that creating a new app should
be roughly equivalent in difficulty to building a simple website leveraging librarian and staff's
pre-existing competencies with such tools as Dreamweaver and CMS systems. While there is training
involved in educating staff about Bootstrap and HTML5, the training burden and requirements for app
development is considerably less than if the library tried to develop native apps for the iOS and
Android environments.
</p>
<h2>Access and Discovery Apps</h2>
<p>
The majority of apps in the initial Colorado College App are categorized as Access and Discovery
Apps, which allow users to find and access the resources represented in the datastore. Access and
Discovery Apps broadly address the generic tasks by users to find, identify, select, and obtain
resources as expressed in the FRBR specification [<a id="ref8" href="#note8">8</a>].  Also included
in this category are apps like the Tutt Library's Hours App, which displays the library's hours of
operations. While not bibliographic in nature, it addresses one of the top questions the library
receives from the patrons wanting to use the library.
</p>
<h3>The Call Number App</h3>
<p>
The Call Number App was the first app released and served as the catalyst for the entire Aristotle
project. As we worked on the discovery layer, another librarian was inspired by a feature in
Stanford University's Searchworks (built with Blacklight and Hydra) that allowed a patron to see
which call numbers were near each other in the library's stacks. While investigating Stanford's
implementation based on Solr, we realized a simplified data model could be used with Redis. To
create the type of sorted indexes needed for this app, normalized Library of Congress, SuDoc, and
local call numbers were added as weights to Redis sorted sets. Once we had embedded the Call Number
App into the discovery layer, we explored the further development of dedicated, simplified apps for
common searches. These independent apps could be used in larger systems, like the discovery layer or
the library's website, through the use of JSON APIs and raw html.
</p>
<h3>Library Hours App</h3>
<p>
When the college adopted a CMS incapable of building a dynamic feed of the library's hours
of operations for the library's homepage, we felt that a dedicated app with a
JSON feed and hours data stored in Redis would work instead. The Library Hours App
stores dates and hours in a set. The patron user interface for the Hours App displays a
simple message with the library's current hours. If the library is closed, the app
displays the next available date and time when the library is open. The app also has an
administrative user interface for authenticated library staff to add or modify the hours
data structures in Redis.  
</p>
<h2>Productivity Apps</h2>
<p>
The second category of apps are for productivity, developed to either manage or report on resources
in the collections represented in the FRBR Redis datastore. These apps require the user to first
authenticate, then, depending on the app and the user's authorizations, allow for the manipulation
or reporting of library information, which includes the native RDA Core FRBR entities in the
datastore. In the Orders App, order records were imported from Tutt Library's legacy ILS into the
FRBR Redis datastore. By doing so, we freed this information from the proprietary and somewhat odd
technical choice of the ILS vendor to tightly bind order information to the MARC bibliographic
record (even going so far as to create custom 9xx fields for order information). By separating the
order information into Redis sets with each invoice and order as distinct Redis keys, visualizations
and budget reporting became much simpler. Before we had this tool we would have to export this data
from the ILS and munge it from MARC, then clean it up before importing it into Microsoft Excel for
analysis of this critical aspect of library operational information.
</p>
<h2>Roadmap for the Aristotle Library App Project</h2>
<p>
Currently, the Tutt Library is using its Call Number App and Hours App to augment the library's
website and discovery layer. These are publicly available, along with the Article and Book Search
Apps, at <a href="http://discovery.coloradocollege.edu/apps/">http://discovery.coloradocollege.edu/
  apps/</a>. The same JSON interface that the Call Number App uses to populate a shelf-browser is
also used in the record view in the discovery layer. The Hours App provides an embedded HTML snippet
for inclusion in various locations in the library's website.
</p>
<p>
Instead of using one large Redis instance for all of the library's bibliographic and operational
data, we are using separate Redis instances for each of the FRBR RDA entities.  Redis is
single-threaded with a small memory footprint and as explained  
</p>
<p>
The next wave of app development will focus on material circulation, including check-out, course
reserves, and inventory. The main users of these workflows will be in the library, serving as
testers and consultants for these productivity apps while the systems group develops and releases
them. In keeping with AGILE philosophy, each app should be simple enough to design, implement, and
start testing within a three-to-four week sprint, which nicely coincides with the current academic
block calendar at Colorado College.
</p>
<h3>App Support for LDAP Authentication</h3>
<p>
Currently, authentication is provided through a custom Django authentication backend
developed to interface with the Tutt Library's legacy ILS. As the Tutt Library transitions
from a traditional ILS to a library apps model, the library plans to use the
identification credentials that primary patrons already have as members of the college
community. As with most organizations, Colorado College uses Microsoft's ActiveDirectory to
manage authentication tasks for networked resources on campus. Using Django's rich and
mature LDAP support, the next piece necessary for an enterprise-level app ecosystem will
be to use these Django tools implemented for the Aristotle Library Apps.
</p>
<h3>Redis Cluster and Consortium Union Catalog</h3>

<img src="http://journal.code4lib.org/media/issue18/Nelson/figure1.png">
<p>
An early concern brought up as challenge from being too radical in technology change as
the Tutt Library moves to an app model for library operations and technical infrastructure
is interoperability, first with the regional Colorado Alliance of Research Library's
Prospector union catalog that Colorado College is both an active lender and borrower for
library material, necessary as the Colorado College operates an block plan of students
taking an intense 3 1/2 week course for a college course credit. With students needing
research material promptly, a strong service point of the Tutt Library is deliver needed
material to students, faculty, and staff as promptly as possible, preferably under 72
hours. The Prospector-based ILL service is critical in the libraryâ€™s ability meet this
tight deadline for materials any replacement or legacy ILS cannot diminish that service.
</p>
<p>
Maintaining MARC record level interoperability should be relatively easy in the Library
App Portfolio as the MARC utilities and productivity apps are in active development.  The
challenge is integrating material request and real-time circulation status into the
proprietary system the Alliance currently uses for the Prospector. A strength of Redis is
its ability to serve, store, and manage large volumes of keys-values for truly
mind-boggling web traffic for such websites as Github, Engine Yard, Craigslist, Disqus,
Stackoverflow, and some major pornograpy sites [<a id="ref9" href="#note9">9</a>].  As
the library gains more experience with using Redis and with the success of very large
websites already using Redis, the library is in the early discussion with the Alliance
about expanding the Aristotle Library Apps project to scale for the millions of records.
</p>
<p>
Some interesting network topologies for bibliographic information may be possible when
using Redis as the underlying and scalable datastore using FRBR/RDA as the organizing
principle. For example the Alliance may host the shared Work and Expression datastore
instances and subscribe to each institutions Manifestation and Items datastores that are
managed and hosted either locally at each institution, by the Alliance, or by using a
commercial cloud provider. Each institution could use the Alliance's hosted Work and
Expression datastores in their own Access and Discovery Apps.
</p>
<p>
Under in active development, Redis Cluster, with plans to have a stable release of Redis
Cluster by the end of 2012. The library and the Alliance are also exploring some grant
opportunities to fund the development and support for this new type of bibliographic
datastore and the scale of hundred of millions of FRBR entities.
